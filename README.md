### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is LiRo5221, and i am a JS developer!
I mostly do discord bots, but i have done some other things.
Invite my bot:
https://discord.ly/lirobot
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on LiRoBot, a discord multipurpose bot. Invite it [here](https://discord.ly/lirobot).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, and i am self-learnt in JS and a bit of HTML.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me at thatfellaliro5221@gmail.com or, if you have a discord account, send me a DM, my name is LiRo5221#0001, since i am not the best at checking my email. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have never taken a course in JS, though it is still my primary development language.
